	with the given analyzer, where 'analyzer' may be specified
	using a simple class name (CAnalyzer) or language name (C)
	(Note, analyzer specification is case sensitive)
	  Ex: -A .foo:CAnalyzer
	      will use the C analyzer for all files ending with .foo
	  Ex: -A bar.:C
	      will use the C analyzer for all files starting with bar.
	  Ex: -A .c:-

  --depth number
	Scanning depth for repositories in directory structure relative to
	source root. Default is 3.
	
  -e, --economical

	It does not generate hyper text cross reference files offline,
	but will do so on demand, which could be sightly slow.
	
  -G, --assignTags 
	Assign commit tags to all entries in history for all repositories.
	
  -H, --history [/path/to/repository]
	Get history for specific repositories (specified as
	absolute path from source root), or ALL repositories

  -I, --include pattern
	Only files matching this pattern will be examined.
	(supports wildcards, example: -I *.java -I *.c)
	
  -i, --ignore pattern
	Ignore the named files (prefixed with 'f:')
	or directories (prefixed with 'd:').
	Supports wildcards (example: -i *.so -i *.dll)
	
  -l, --lock on/off
	Turn on/off locking of the Lucene database during index generation.
	
  --leadingWildCards on/off
	Allow or disallow leading wildcards in a search.
	
  --listRepos
	List all repository paths and exit.
	
  -m, --memory number
	Amount of memory that may be used for buffering added documents and
	deletions before they are flushed to the directory (default 16.0MB).
	Please increase JVM heap accordingly, too.

  -P, --projects 
	Generate a project for each top-level directory in source root.
	
  -p, --defaultProject /path/to/default/project
	This is the path to the project that should be selected
	by default in the web application (when no other project
	set either in cookie or in parameter). May be used multiple
	times for several projects. Use "__all__" for all projects.
	You should strip off the source root.
	
  --progress
	Print per project percentage progress information.
	(I/O extensive, since one read through directory structure is
	made before indexing, needs -v, otherwise it just goes to the log)
	
  -Q, --quickScan on/off
	Turn on/off quick context scan. By default, only the first
	1024k of a file is scanned, and a '[..all..]' link is inserted

	           which allow getting history for directories.
